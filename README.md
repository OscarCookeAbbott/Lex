# Lex - Dialogue System

> **Lex**icon: _The vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge_.

Lex aims to create a new dialogue syntax which is concise, straightforward and powerful _enough_.

## Project

This repo includes an official Lex **parser** written in _Rust_, which can either be used to ingest Lex dialogue into a Rust project, or to convert from Lex into a desired alternate data format (JSON etc).

This repo also includes an official basic Lex **player** written in _Rust_ which can be used for basic testing and demoing of Lex dialogue files via CLI.
